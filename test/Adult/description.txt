Description of fnlwgt:
	| Description of fnlwgt (final weight)
	|
	| The weights on the CPS files are controlled to independent estimates of the
	| civilian noninstitutional population of the US.  These are prepared monthly
	| for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau.  We use 3 sets of
	| controls.
	|  These are:
	|          1.  A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.
	|          2.  Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.
	|          3.  Controls by Race, age and sex.
	|
	| We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and "rake" through
	| them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used.
	|
	| The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating
	| "weighted tallies" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the
	| population.
	|
	| People with similar demographic characteristics should have
	| similar weights.  There is one important caveat to remember
	| about this statement.  That is that since the CPS sample is
	| actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own
	| probability of selection, the statement only applies within
	| state.


5.	Number of samples in training set:	32561
	Number of samples in test set:		16281	

6. 	Class distribution (training set): 	7841/32561 have income over 50K
	Class distribution (test set):		3846/16281 have income over 50K

7.	Results:
	Accuracy: 81.3% with NN trained with learning rate of 0.05 over 100 epochs
		compared to 86% achieved by Donor of dataset.
		No improvements could be seen when changing the learning rate or increasing the number of epochs.  Decreasing the number of epochs produced worse results.
	Data on other metrics couldnâ€™t be found.
